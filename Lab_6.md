# Lab 6

In this lab we look into a implementation of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) in PyTorch.

Check the file [`6_DQN_LunarLander.ipynb`](6_DQN_LunarLander.ipynb)
which implements a DQN on the [LunarLander](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) environment.


### Task 1:
Try to understand the code in the notebook and try to match it to the DQN algorithm that was shown in the lecture.

### Task 2:
The code does not work yet, since the loss function is not implemented.
At the end of the notebook you see some tasks that guide you along the way of setting up that loss function. Complete these individual tasks.
Note: The solution is already uploaded on GitHub. If you get stuck on one of the tasks you can have a look at the solution, but make sure that you first try it on your own.
